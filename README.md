5. Feature Extraction and Matching
6. Image Segmentation
7. Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction
8. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)
9. Gesture Recognition
10. Motion Detection and Tracking

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects and examples in this repository, you will need to set up an environment with OpenCV installed. You can follow the installation instructions provided in the OpenCV documentation or refer to the specific README file in each project directory for installation guidelines.

Once you have set up your environment, you can navigate to the directory of the algorithm or application you're interested in and follow the instructions provided in the README file. The example code is written in Python and accompanied by explanations, making it easy to understand and follow along.

Feel free to experiment with the code and adapt it to your specific needs. You can use your own images or videos to apply the algorithms and explore their capabilities further. The repository encourages hands-on learning and encourages you to modify the code to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts.
